# Meta Data Analyst with GenAI

## 📊 Project Overview
This capstone project analyzes Facebook and Google AdWords ad performance using data cleaning, visualization, and regression modeling to uncover insights and optimize marketing strategies. The project demonstrates how statistical analysis and GenAI tools can support data-driven marketing decisions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the relationship between **ad clicks** and **conversions** across platforms.  
- Apply **data cleaning**, **visualization**, and **linear regression modeling**.  
- Identify which ad platform demonstrates higher predictive power for conversions.  
- Provide actionable **marketing recommendations** based on data insights.

## 🧠 Methodology
1. **Data Collection** – Ad performance dataset including clicks, impressions, and conversions.  
2. **Data Cleaning** – Removed nulls, handled outliers, and formatted data for analysis.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualized key trends using scatterplots and summary statistics.  
4. **Modeling** – Performed simple linear regression to analyze correlation between clicks and conversions.  
5. **Interpretation** – Evaluated coefficients, R² value, and residuals to assess model fit.
